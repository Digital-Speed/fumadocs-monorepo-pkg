# Specification Quality Checklist: Embed Documentation as Component

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: MVP layout integration, P2: developer experience, P3: production deployment)
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering embedding, routing, hot reload, and build pipeline
- Measurable success criteria focused on user/developer experience rather than implementation
- Well-defined assumptions about technology compatibility and constraints
- Edge cases identified for error scenarios and routing conflicts

**Notes**:
- All requirements are testable through the verification approach defined in the constitution (type checking, linting, builds)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all aspects have reasonable defaults based on standard monorepo patterns
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin technical implementation planning
